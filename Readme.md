This is my class 12 IP. Its about library management and is doine using the 'python' language. You gotta run 'startup.py' first, as it creates the nescessary databases required to run the program.
Then run, the main program. You have help option given inside the program for each block, which will come in handy. and this is btw my first GIT commit
